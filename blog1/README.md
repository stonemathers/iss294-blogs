### Art Piece 1

Since 1999, Daniel Rozin has created a series of works called Mechanical Mirrors. In these pieces, he uses a camera to capture the subject standing in front of the mirror. This image is then processed through a computer, which is attached to a grid of motors. After the captured image is appropriately interpreted, the motors shift the components of the mirror to reflect that image. I was drawn to these works because I believe they are a unique and entertaining union of technology, basic physical components, and artistic perspective. The repurposed physical materials create a new outlook on the reflected subject. I especially liked Rozin’s Wooden Mirror, pictured above on display at the Israel Museum, as the shadowing created by the angles of its wooden “pixels” results in an especially detailed reflection. I also enjoyed his use of toys, such as the Penguins Mirror and the Troll Mirror (pictured below).
