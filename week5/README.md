### The Cave of Rebirth

The Cave of Rebirth is a song written and performed by Armenian jazz pianist Tigran Hamasyan. For the accompanying music video, visual artist Julius Horsthuis created a series of algorthmically generated and animated 3D fractals. This natural, yet otherworldly aesthetic perfectly accompanies the trance-like music of Hamasyan, which itself sounds ethereal but human. I was drawn to this piece for, while the visuals do follow the fluctuating emotions of the music, they were clearly not precisely planned. While certain paramaters can be entered to guide the visuals towards a certain feeling, it is still an act of exploration and discovery.
